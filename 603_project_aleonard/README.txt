My program uses tkinter to create a GUI that asks a few questions about their day.

It uses multiple different widgets provided by tkinter to collect data and then save the inputs to a text file.

************

To run the program you should simply need to open the GUIProject.py file and select the run option.
The GUI will pop up and you will make your entries.
There is no enforcement requiring you fill out all the widgets but the text file will leave blanks inbetween the commas separating each data point.
opening the GUI_Input.txt file after you have clicked save, you should see the data you added below what is already in there.
quiting the file before you save will result in no data being written to the file.
When the gui is open, you can save data multiple times and it should write a new line each time it is save.
