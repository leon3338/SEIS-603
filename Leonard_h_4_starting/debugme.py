# The code below has bugs.  There may be more than one.
#
# Add a comment to the code for each such error.
#   It should describe the location of the error,
#   the type of the error (syntax, runtime, or semantic)
#   and why it's an error of that type.

# Then fix the code so there are no errors.


n = int(input("Enter an integer n: "))
print("Here's your integer: ", n)

#name mismatch with uppercase and lowercase n when declared and uppercase in print statement, this is a semantic error
# ask for a integer on line 1 but the type is actually going to be a float, this is a semantic error
#use a } instead of a ) to close the first statement, this is a syntax error on the first line
#use a] instead of a ) on the second line, this is a syntax error
#mix both single and double quotes on first line, is a syntax error.
#use single quotes and have an apostrophe on second line, this is a syntax error.
