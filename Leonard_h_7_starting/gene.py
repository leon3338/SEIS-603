'''
Determine if seq represents a potential gene, by checking it satisfies each of the following 4-part codon criteria:

1.	The number of bases in seq is a multiple of 3 (len(seq) is evenly divisible by 3). 
2.	seq begins with the start codon ATG, where a codon is a sequence of three consecutive bases starting at a seq index 
    evenly divisible by 3.
3.	seq ends with any one of the stop codons TAG, TAA, or TGA.
4.	seq has no intervening stop codons (one of the above) anywhere in the codon sequence between the first and last 
    codons. 

Remember that any 3-sequence of bases is a codon ONLY if it begins on an index of seq thatâ€™s evenly divisible by 3.
